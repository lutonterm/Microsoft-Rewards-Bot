Please agree to these rules and info before getting this repo. Also will be in the console of the Python script.

1. You have a limited time of using this bot due to it being too overpowered. Take an example from Sweepstakes or Select 3. You can get so much points easily and if you're lucky enough you might win upwards of 211k (select 3) or a device in Sweepstakes.

2. To even use this software, you need a key. This is due to verification. Send me a DM on Twitter asking for a key and I'll send a form.

3. Your key shall not be shared. In a future update, the key will not work on other devices.

4. If Microsoft CorporationÂ® or any company/business requests a takedown on this application, I WILL close this. This app will have an account system (you will not be able to add or remove it). When Microsoft/a business requests a takedown, all accounts will be taken down (permanent termination) so will the repository.

5. Please do not make any videos/posts about this. Make one video/post and that's it. This rule is not required.

6. I value your privacy. The script will not be open-source due to awareness of number 4. Your PC password, IDs, software and hardware will never be collected.

7. Please run this while not doing anything. It will give best performance plus it won't slow your computer down.
